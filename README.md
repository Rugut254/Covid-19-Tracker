#INSIGHTS
From our data we were able to realise that the pandemic heavily hit parts of Europe and Asia since they recorded the highest number of cases globally. Technocrats argued that the higher number of cases in Europe was due to sudden emergence of the pandemic ehich caught them unprepared leading to higher fatalities and number of cases recorded. Asia also was it most due to unexpectation in the region and also the number of population contributed since the disease spreaded first.


North and South America recorded less cases as compared to Asia and Europe whilist Africa and Oceania were last on the list having recorded the list cases across the globe and this due to the fact that transport was restricted which prevented the Continents from contamination.

The correlation between deaths recorded was high since the countries with the most cases recorded the highest number of deaths.
The daily trends was observed to be more in American Samoa region with African countries recording the least daily trends.
